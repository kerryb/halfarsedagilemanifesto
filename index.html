    <h1>Manifesto for Half-Arsed Agile Software Development</h1>
    <p id="introduction">
      We have heard about new ways of developing software by<br />
      paying consultants and reading Gartner reports. Through<br />
      this we have been told to value:
    </p>
    <div id="values">
      <p><span class="more">Individuals and interactions</span>
        <span class="less">over processes and tools</span></p>
      <p class="qualification">and we have mandatory processes and tools to
        control how those<br />
        individuals (we prefer the term &lsquo;resources&rsquo;) interact</p>
      <p><span class="more">Working software</span>
        <span class="less">over comprehensive documentation</span></p>
      <p class="qualification">as long as that software is comprehensively
        documented</p>
      <p><span class="more">Customer collaboration</span>
        <span class="less">over contract negotiation</span></p>
      <p class="qualification">within the boundaries of strict contracts, of
        course, and subject to rigorous change control</p>
      <p><span class="more">Responding to change</span>
        <span class="less">over following a plan</span></p>
      <p class="qualification">provided a detailed plan is in place to
        respond to the change, and it is followed precisely</p>
    </div>
    <p id="conclusion">That is, while the items on the left sound<br />
      nice in theory, we're an enterprise company, and there's no<br />
      way we're letting go of the items on the right.</p>
